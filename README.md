# RNA-seq Analysis of Drosophila melanogaster

## Overview
This repository contains a complete RNA-seq workflow comparing
Control and Mutated samples of Drosophila melanogaster.

## Dataset
- 4 samples
- 2 biological replicates per condition
- Paired-end sequencing

## Tools Used
- fastp
- STAR
- Linux command-line utilities
- DESeq2 (via iDEP)
- Metascape

## Workflow
1. Quality control and trimming
2. Genome indexing
3. Read alignment
4. Count matrix generation
5. Differential expression analysis
6. Functional enrichment analysis
